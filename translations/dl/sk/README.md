We welcome translators and proofreaders.

Contributors can visit https://crowdin.com/project/falling-sky
and immediately start making suggestions, as well as giving +1 to
existing translations that they approve of.

Translations are published every half hour to http://i18n.test-ipv6.com. 
After review, the public web site build will be started, incorporating
your suggestions on mirrors around the world.

Proofreaders can start as contributors - and as it is apparent
that a proofreader has a strong masterly of the translation, 
I can grant access rights to approve specific translations (overriding
popular votes).

We welcome requests for new languages, for people willing to contribute.  
My ask is that anyone asking for a new langauge commit to the first 10% of
the translation; it is the most important 10%.  All untranslated text will
appear as English for the visitors.


We can only accomodoate left-to-right reading langauges at this time.
We do not have the ability at this time to properly format right-to-left
reading script langauges such as Arabic or Hebrew.  


test-ipv6.com is proving to be a valuable asset to people debugging their
connectivity.  However, not everyone in the world speaks English; as such,
it is desirable to have support for other languages.

Thanks for your interest,

Jason Fesler
