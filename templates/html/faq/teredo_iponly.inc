{{ You also appear to have Teredo enabled.  You did successfully connect
  to an IPv6 site during this test - but only when forcing the connection
  by connecting to an IPv6 numeric address, instead of a web site name.
  This setting will not help or hurt you going forward to reach
  IPv6 web sites.
