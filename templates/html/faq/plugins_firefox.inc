<p>
{{ In the case of Firefox, the most common
plugins that cause problems are AdBlock and RequestPolicy.
There are probably others - any which claims to prevent XSS, CSRF,  
or Cross Site Scripting can be a problem.
Try disabling these plugins (either temporarilly via any menu they offer you, or via the Firefox add-ons menu).
